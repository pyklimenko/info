## About Me

Architect and teacher. Since 2009 I have been engaged in architectural practice.
Since 2014, I have been interested in computational design and digital manufacturing. Today I teach students at the Moscow Architectural Institute to use algorithms when creating architecture. We create parametric installations and art objects.
In my professional activity, I am involved in design processes where programming is required, and I also develop software tools for architectural design.
